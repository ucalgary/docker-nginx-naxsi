# NGINX Anti XSS & SQL Injection

[NAXSI](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi) is an open-source, high performance, low rules maintenance web application firewall (WAF) for NGINX. This Docker image is a customization of the [official nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) with the NAXSI module added, and without some of the modules in the official image that are not needed.

Only [nginx mainline on Alpine](https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/tree/master/mainline/alpine) is supported in this repo.

## Maintenance

This repository and image are currently maintained by the Research Management Systems project at the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca/).
